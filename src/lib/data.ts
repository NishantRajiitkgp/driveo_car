  {
    q: "Can you wash my car in a condo underground parking lot?",
    a: "Yes — we built GLEAM specifically for this. Our pros use professional waterless and rinseless products that require zero water hookup, leave zero water runoff, and violate zero building rules. We've washed hundreds of vehicles in underground parking across Mississauga and Etobicoke. Your property manager won't hear a thing.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if I'm not happy with the wash?",
    a: "We guarantee your satisfaction. If anything doesn't meet your expectations, we'll send a pro back to redo it at no charge. If you're still not satisfied, you get a full refund. We can offer this because every job is photo-documented — we hold ourselves to the same standard you see in the photos.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need to be present during the wash?",
    a: "No. Most of our clients aren't. Just leave your car accessible — whether that's your driveway, a parking spot, or your condo's visitor parking. We'll text you when we arrive, when we're done, and send your before/after photos so you can see everything without being there.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens if it rains on the day of my appointment?",
    a: "We reschedule for free — no fees, no hassle. If it's light rain, we can still do interior-only services. For subscription members, we'll automatically find the next available slot within your billing cycle so you never lose a service.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do you screen your wash pros?",
    a: "Every GLEAM provider has 2+ years of professional car care experience, passes a hands-on test scored by our quality team (minimum 7.5/10), carries $2M liability insurance, and undergoes a background check. We also run random quality audits and track customer satisfaction on every single job.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I skip a month or cancel my subscription?",
    a: "Skip once per quarter with one tap in your account. Cancel anytime with 30 days' notice — no penalty, no fees, no guilt trip. We don't do contracts because we'd rather earn your business every month than lock you in.",
